                <h2>Information Collected</h2>
                <p>You do not have to provide Personal Information (as defined below) to visit or use this Website or this App. However, depending on the Website and/or the App activity that you choose to engage in, we will collect information from you. The information we collect depends upon your interactions with us, and your internet browser settings.</p>
                
                <p>As used in this Policy, "personal information" is information that identifies, relates to, describes, references, or is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household ("Personal Information"). The Website may collect the following Personal Information from you when you complete an inquiry to Senergy via the Website and/or App contact page form and/or subscribe to the Senergy AI e-mail list, including but not limited to: your first name, last name, e-mail address, job title, phone number and company name. For processing payments, we collect payment information including credit card numbers and shipping addresses. Payments are processed by third-party payment processors.</p>
                
                <p>Senergy AI also may collect aggregate non-personally identifiable information ("NPII") (such as your web browser, operating system, pages visited, Internet Protocol [IP] address etc.). While this data may be associated with a specific device, it is not associated with a unique person or identity. For instance, when you visit the Website or the App, our web server will automatically recognize some NPII, including the date and time you visited our Website or our App, the pages you visited, device information, your Internet Protocol (IP) address and locale. We also collect information about links clicked, searches, pages viewed, and time spent.</p>

                <h2>Cookies and Analytics</h2>
                <p>When you use our Website and/or our App, we may collect information from and store cookies on your computer in order to optimize your user experience by showing you new and relevant content based upon your prior browsing history on our Website or our App. A cookie is a small data text file, which a Website or App stores on your device's hard drive (if your internet browser permits) that can later be retrieved to identify you to us. Our cookies store a randomly assigned user identification number necessary to keep you logged into our Website and our App. The collection of this data by these third parties is subject to the third parties' own privacy policies.</p>
                
                <p>We also work with third-party analytics or marketing partner companies that collect information about visitors to our Website and our App, and report Website and App trends without directly identifying individual visitors. These services allow us to view a variety of reports about how visitors interact with the Website and the App, so we can improve our Website and our App, and understand how people find and navigate it.</p>
                
                <p>With the exception of the use of such technologies by our service providers or other authorized third parties, we do not permit any other third-party content on Websites or Apps to include or utilize any cookies, web beacons, local storage, or similar technologies for tracking purposes or to collect your Personal Information.</p>

We may share certain information with these third-party ad companies, and we and them may use cookies, pixels tags, and other tools to collect usage and browsing information within our Services, as well as on third-party sites, apps, and services, such as IP address, location information, device ID, cookie and advertising IDs, and other identifiers, as well as browsing information.
